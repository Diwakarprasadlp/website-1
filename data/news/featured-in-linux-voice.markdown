[Linux Voice](http://www.linuxvoice.com/) was originally funded by a hugely successful crowdfunding campaign. 
Moreover, Linux Voice is a different kind of Linux magazine:

- 50% of the profits go back to the Free Software community, developers and events.
- The content is freely licensed (CC-BY-SA) after nine months.
