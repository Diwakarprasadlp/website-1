[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) is a dedicated ARM-Based cloud platform (IaaS) created by [Online](http://www.online.net/). 
Iliad, the group behind Online.net, [Free](http://www.free.fr/) and Scaleway, is a popular French company.

Basically, you get a bare-metal server for the price of a virtual machine. 
They build their own hardware with ARM processors which is pretty cool.

Kanboard is available as "InstantApp" on Scaleway. With only one click, you can provision a private server with Kanboard pre-installed.

I tried the Kanboard InstantApp myself and that works pretty well.
