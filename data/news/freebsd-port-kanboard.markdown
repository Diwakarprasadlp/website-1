Title: FreeBSD port for Kanboard
Date: 2015-08-24
---

Kanboard is now available in the official FreeBSD port tree.
That means you can install Kanboard directly with pkg:

```bash
pkg install apache24 mod_php56 kanboard
```

All dependencies are installed automatically, it's so easy!

This package is created and maintained by the community. Big thanks to the person behind that :)
